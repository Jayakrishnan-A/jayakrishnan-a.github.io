<p align="justify"> I’m Jayakrishnan Anandakrishnan (Member, IEEE), a dedicated and versatile researcher with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics, and advanced spatiotemporal integration using Remote Sensing, GIS, UAVs, and Edge-IoT Intelligence. My work focuses on creating innovative, data-driven solutions for real-world challenges such as predictive modeling, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analytics. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Kerala University, India, in 2011, and completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Image Processing from Cochin University of Science and Technology, India, in 2013. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Puducherry (NITPY), India, in 2025. My research expertise was further enriched through an international internship under the International Internship Pilot Program (IIPP), funded by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), Taiwan.</p>
